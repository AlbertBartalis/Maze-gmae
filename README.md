# Maze-game
Maze game is implemented with object oriented programming. The user must help the mouse to find the cheese in a maze. He can do this by moving along in the maze using direction keys, or by giving coordinates of where the cheese might be. The maze is a dynamically allocated 2d array, in which 0 represents an open space and 1 represents a wall. The cheese is randomly hidden on an open spot in the maze and the focus of the game is to locate it. If the user gives up on trying to find the cheese, he can select an option, where the computer solves the problem for him and shows afterwards all the coordinates where it searched.
